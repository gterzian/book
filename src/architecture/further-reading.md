* [More how browsers work](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm) article that is dated, but has many more details

* [Fast and parallel web page layout (2010)](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lmeyerov/projects/pbrowser/pubfiles/paper.pdf) - Leo Meyerovich's influential parallel selectors, layout, and fonts.
  It advocates seperating parallel selectors from parallel cascade to improve memory usage.
