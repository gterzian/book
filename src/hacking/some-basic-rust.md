# Some basic Rust

Even if you have never seen any Rust code, it's not too hard to read Servo's code.
But there are some basics things one must know:

- [Match](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/flow_control/match.html) and [Patterns](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html)
- [Options](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/std/option.html)
- [Expression](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/expression.html)
- [Traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/trait.html)
- That doesn't sound important, but be sure to understand how `println!()` works, especially the [formatting traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#formatting-traits)

This won't be enough to do any serious work at first, but if you want to navigate the code and fix basic bugs, that should do it.
It's a good starting point, and as you dig into Servo source code, you'll learn more.
